Author's description:

I decided to do this cursor set, since Mew is one of my favorite Pokemon. I gotta admit, my creativity completely ran out while i was making the Move, Precision select, and Handwriting cursor. I still wanted to make them, because i wanted to make my first full cursor set. I really hope you guys enjoy this cursor set. I thought of it, because i recently  have been thinking about re-playing Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky with Mew as my starter, here's the cheat code for drastic it if you're interested on doing it:
